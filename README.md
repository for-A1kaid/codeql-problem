# codeql-problem
I am using CodeQL version 2.14.1, and when I tried to create a database based on the source code in the src directory of this repository , I encountered this issue: https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/11829.

```
python run.py db src
```

Make sure you have modified the codeql_path path in run.py.
